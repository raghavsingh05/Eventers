# Eventers
An online Event Management System

The **Eventers** is a web and mobile-based platform designed to streamline the process of organizing events for hosts and simplifying guest management through QR code check-ins. Using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the web app and a mobile app for scanning QR codes, this system provides real-time attendance tracking and event management.

The platform allows event hosts to create and manage events, track guest RSVPs, and view live attendance data. Guests can enroll in events via the web interface and check in using their QR codes at the event, reducing duplicate entries and ensuring smooth event execution.

## Features
- Event creation and management for hosts
- Guest enrollment via web interface
- Real-time guest check-ins using QR code scanning (mobile app)
